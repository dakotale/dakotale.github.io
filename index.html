								<b>Hey There!  My name is Dakota.  I am a graduate of the University at Buffalo, with a Bachelor degree in Computer Science.</b><br></br>
								<b>Now that the boring stuff is out of the way, let's get into more interesting
								facts and tidbits about me.</b>  <li>I like to think of myself as a free spirit, as someone who "goes with the flow."</li>  <li>I have always been a huge fan of the Adirondacks since I was little. I would go on vacation every year when I was younger to all the beautiful lakes and forests that the Adirondacks have to offer.</li>  <li>In my free time I really enjoy to tinker and play video games.  Currently my games of choice have been Overwatch or Diablo. *subject to change :)</li>  <li>I know that I wanted to go into development when I was in high school through the continuing projects with the Project Lead the Way program at my school.  My enjoyment of all things digital carried over to college and I've been happy ever since.</li>
