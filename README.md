These are my files for my personal website (dakotale.github.io).  This site is still a work in progress.  I have used a combination of HTML and CSS to create this website.  This website is a central hub for all personal files and links.  These include my resume, Github, LinkedIn, and my email.  Thank you for looking at my site.
